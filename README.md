## Description
This application is meant to show THREE.js animations embedded on a webpage and their functionality. Users can log in/out to save certain parameters.
- The log in and sign up page both have a background that moves with the cursor.
- The Box Simulation page displays a cube animation. The animation's parameters, such as length, widht, height, color, etc., can be changed and saved for future tinkering. 
- The YouCube page also displays a cube, but four sides of the cubes have youtube videos imbedded. There is a search function where the user can find their favorite video to add to the animation. This works with the youtube
api. Those videos the user searched can be loaded again the next time they log in with a click of a button.
